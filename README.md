# optimML
A fast and flexible C++ library for numeric optimization of complex log likelihood functions, including mixture components that must sum to 1

## Requirements
Only requires a C++11 compiler. Also depends on the [stlbfgs](https://github.com/nkschaefer/stlbfgs) library, which is included as a submodule. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/ultimaille/stlbfgs), and the forked version was modified to be compatible with older compilers.
